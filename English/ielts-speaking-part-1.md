# IELTS Speaking Part 1

## 询问客观事实

询问客观事实的题，一般提供事实性的回答就可以了。

__Do you work or study?/what do you do for a living?__

Well, I have been working as a software engineer for five years. I used to work for a hardware company. However, I have to say that I was laid off due to COVID, but fortunately I found another job in a media company afterwards and I have been working there for three years.

注意这道题的回答就是描述了一下客观事实。注意雅思考试和平时对话是不同的。平时对话一般回答I am working as a software engineer 就可以了，如果对方想要更多细节，对方会反问。但是雅思考试你要回答得长才行，因为长的回答可以展示更多语法结构和词汇量。

注意过去式 I used to work 和 I was laid off。雅思考试会有一两道题询问过去的事情，考察使用过去式的能力，如果能在其他问题中使用过去式是很好的加分。同时注意现在完成进行时 I have been working for the new company company for three years。描述过去开始并且一直持续到现在的动作都可以用现在完成进行时。最后，注意 Well, However, I have to say 等开场词和连接词。

__What kind of family do you come from?__

Although I don't have any brothers or sisters due to the one-child policy in China, I live in an extended family with my parents, uncles, anuts and cousins. My older male cousin has been married but my two younger female cousins are still in high school. They are not only smart but also hard-working so I am sure they will be admitted into excellent universities. I really love my family, especially my parents.

这道题的回答也类似，以客观事实为主，但是最后加入了一点点自己的观点态度。回答有关家庭的问题时，一般从事实角度回答最方便。

也可以将询问事实的题当作询问观点态度的题进行回答，参考下面关于观点态度题的回答方法。

## 询问地点

回答关于地点的问题，可以使用这种句式 my xxx is not only peaceful but also beautiful with hospitable people. I should say, there are several advantages there ... 。

__Let’s talk about where you live. Can you describe your neighborhood?__

Well, whichever way you look at it, my neighborhood is not only peaceful but also beautiful with hospitable people. I should say, there are several advantages there. First and foremost, there are numerious fantastic restaurants nearby, especially asian foods which I really enjoy. Another merit is that the neighborhood gets an amazing shopping mall where people enjoy wonderful night lives. However, the housing price is awfully high. In particular, I have been paying 2000 dollars a month for my studio. 

这种结构可以用于很多关于地点的问题。比如下面这个例子。

__What is a disadvantage of living in your neighborhood?__

Well, whichever way you look at it, my neighborhood is not only peaceful but also beautiful with hospitable people. However, there are several disadvantages there. First and foremost, the housing price is awfully high. For example, I have been paying 2000 dollars a month for my studio. Another dismerit is that the roads and bus stops are usually horribly dirty and no one seems to be cleaning them regularly. Last but not not least, the freeway nearby is always terribly congested, especially during peek hours.

注意如果前面两点和第三点之间没有转折，则用 last but not least，否则使用 however。

再看一个例子。

__Can you describe your hometown?__

Well, whichever way you look at it, my hometown is not only peaceful but also beautiful with hospitable people. I should say, there are several advantages there. First and foremost, my hometown gets several amazing shopping malls where people enjoy their wonderful night lives. Another merit is that the teachers in my hometowm are really incredible, not only are they caring but they have excellent teaching skills as well. However, my hometown doesn't have sufficient jobs for me to make a fortune, that is why I came to the United States to seek better oppotunities.

最后一个例子。

__Can you describe your country?__

Well, whichever way you look at it, China is a beautiful and peaceful country with hospitable people. I should say, there are several advantages there. First and foremost, there are plenty of job oppotunites in China, it's easy to find a job especially if you have an advanced degree. Another merit is that cities in China get fantastic shopping malls where people enjoy their wonderful night lives.

当然同样的套路不能用两次。如果出现了两道关于地点的题，我们可以用下面讲解的回答观点态度问题的方法。

## 观点态度题

观点态度题，要么直接询问喜不喜欢某事物，要么让考生说自己最喜欢或者最不喜欢的事物。

观点态度题的一般套路是四步走：

- 第一步，转折
- 第二步，表明观点
- 第三步，解释理由
- 第四步，再转折一次

__Do you like singing?__

Well, despite the fact that many Chinese people love singing, I really loathe it. The primary reason is that not only is it hard for me to follow the melody of songs, especially when the rhythm is complex, but also I can hardly understand the feeling expressed by songs. Nevertheless, I sometimes sing songs with my friends, especially during parties.

注意我们这里使用了 despite 来表示第一次转折，使用 loathe 来表明观点，使用 the primary reason is that 来引出理由，使用 not only ... but also 来并列两条理由，使用 especially 来使理由更加具体，最后再使用 nevertheless 来进行第二次转折。我们可以使用更灵活的方式，比如表达转折还可以使用 although/though/however，表达观点可以使用各种表示观点态度的动词和形容词，引出理由可以使用 the main reason is that 或者 since，并列两条理由还可以使用 both and，表达更加具体的理由还可以使用 in particular 或者 particularly。

使用这种套路可以启发思维，鼓励我们从正反两方面思考所询问对象的好处和坏处，并且从多方面思考理由。

这种结构的缺点在于很难插入较长的例子，因为 not only ... but also ... 整体是一条句子，在里面再加入 for example 会破坏句子结构。

__Do you like learning English?__

Well, despite the fact that many people really enjoy learning English, I have to say that learning English is horrible for me. The main reason is that not only is it difficult for me to make sense of the English grammar, especially the tenses since we don't have the concept of tenses in the Chinese language, but also I can hardly pronounce the words correctly. Nevertheless, I have to suck it up since excellent English skills are necessary to make a living in the United States.

如果有些部分想不到，可以省略。比如没法写转折可以省略前面的despite，没办法想出两个理由可以省略not only/but also，没办法想出更具体的理由可以省略especially。

__What do you like doing at the weekends?__

Well, in spite of the fact that many of my friends like to go out on weekends, I’m keen on staying at home with a good book. The primary reason is that not only does reading a book makes me feel relaxed, especially if I’m worried about my work, but also it puts me in a good mood. Nevertheless, I sometimes go out with my friends, especially if the weather is nice. 

__What is your favorite meal of the day?__

Well, usually I love lunch the best since I can listen to my favorite music when I eat lunch. However, sometimes I prefer dinner since I can explore some great restaurants with my friends, espcially if there are huge discounts.

__Which type of music do you like the best?__

I want to tell you that I only love anime music since I am a big fan of animes. Especially, I enjoy listening to the sound tracks of my favorite animes such as White Album, Your lie in April and Clannad.

__Which season do you like the most?__

Well, despite the fact that many Americans love the spring season, I am fond of winter. The main reason is that not only can I play with snow in winters, but I can try some exciting sports like skiing as well, especially near the Tahoe lake. 

__What is your least favorite food?__

Well, although I love most of Chinese foods, I have to say that I can't stand stinky tofu since they smells so disgusting, just like the odor from dirty sewers.

在用回答观点态度题的方法回答其他问题时，我们尤其需要省略一些结构，因为需要把复杂的结构留给“正宗的”观点态度题。

下面用回答观点态度题的方法回答事实类问题。

__Do you live in an apartment or house?__

I have been living in my current apartment for 3 years. I really love it since the manager is so caring and helpful. In particular, everytime I request a repair, he will dispatch someone to my home immediately.

注意这里我们的套路，简单介绍了一下我生活在 apartment 然后立刻改变成回答我喜欢我的 apartment。

__Can you describe your job?__

Well, my job is really fantastic since I can work remotely. Working from home is incredible for me because not only can I get rid of the hustle and bustle of commuting to the office, but also I can take a short nap during the day, especially if I feel tired. Nevertheless, sometimes I have to go to the office for company events, especially the all-hands since everyone is required to show up.

注意这里一上来就回答我的工作很棒，直接当成了观点态度题回答。

下面用回答观点态度题的方法回答地点类问题。

__Can you describe your hometown?__

Well, my hometown is really fantastic since there are amazing teachers, not only are they caring but also they have excellent teaching skills. However, my hometown doesn't have sufficient jobs for me to make a fortune, that is why I came to the United States to seek better oppotunities.

注意这里一上来就回答我的家乡很棒，直接当成了观点态度题回答。

我们需要注意的是有时题目让我们说自己最喜欢的东西。我们喜欢的东西不止一个，我们可以先列举喜欢的东西，然后说最喜欢什么。比如：

__Who is your favorite entrepreneur?__

I have been always admiring entrepreneurs in the software industry, such as Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Larry Page. Among them, Bill Gates is my favorite since he has been donating an enormous amount of money to charity. Especially, he has made incredible contributions to the development of COVID vaccines, which save countless lives in the world.

下面这个问题和最喜欢不太一样，但是也可以用相同的处理方法。

__What is the best way to learn how to use a computer?__

Well there are plenty of approaches to learn this phenomenon, such as taking courses or reading books. However, the best approach, I would like to say, is to learn by practice. Just to give you an idea, I significantly improved my typing speed by playing computer games since communicating with other players in real time is essential in online games.

注意这里我们采用的也是先列举，再提出观点的方法。这题问的是学习电脑的最好方法，这是一种相对客观的事情而不是主观感受，要讲理由不太容易，所以这题我们给出一个例子。

有时我们可以回答过去的喜好，并且和现在的喜好进行对比。

__What do you like doing at the weekends?__

Well, I used to love going out and exploring wonderful restaurants during weekends since I am a big fan of delicious foods. However, recently I have been staying at home to prepare for the IELTS exam.

特别是回答某种不良爱好时，我们可以将过去和现在进行对比.

__What was your favorite food when you were a child?__

Well, to tell you the truth, as a kid, I was prone to junk foods such as burgers, fries and fried chicken. Among them, fried chicken was my favorite since it's so delicious. My abiding memory is of my mom taking me to Kentucky Fried Chicken every week. However, I enrolled into a course about foods and people's health during my college years. In the course I learned that junk foods contribute a great deal to people's health problems such as obesity and cancer. Since then I have been eating less junk foods because I want to be healthier.

注意这里的对比方法，提供的理由：上大学时的一门课。同时注意当题目问 when you were a child 的时候，换成 as a kid。最后描述自己的改变适合用现在完成进行时。

同样的故事还可以回答 Have your eating habits changed over the past 10 years? 或者 Is it important to you to eat healthy food?

__How often do you use your cell phone?__

Well, to tell you the truth, I was so addicted to mobile phones during my high school years. I used my iPhone mainly to connect with my friends and play games. However, I enrolled into a course about technology and the society when I was in college. In that course I learned that mobile phones contribute a great deal to people's health problems such as obesity and anxiety. Since then I have been using my mobile phone less and less frequently because I want to be healthier.

## 对比两个对立的事物

这种题可以使用 on the one hand ... on the other hand ... 结构。

__Do you like living in a house or an apartment?__

Well, on the one hand, the benefits of living in an apartment are manifold. First and foremost, apartments are usually located in the bustling areas where people could enjoy their wonderful night lives. It's also worth mentioning that living in an apartment is more convenient since apartments are often staffed with management teams who take charge of the maintainence and repair. On the other hand, the advantages of living in an house cannot be ignored. Just to give you an idea, a house is more spacious so there is more room for the children to play. All in all, I should say, since life quality and convenience are of vital importance to me, I would prefer to live in an apartment.

这种套路可以用在比较两个对立的事物上。注意一些高级的表达方式，比如 manifold，cannot be ignored 被动语气，用 just to give you an idea 代替 for example，用 All in all 代替 In conclusion，用 of vital importance / vitally important 代替 iomportant，用 benefits 和 advantages 这两个不同的词表示优点。

__Do you like studying in a librray or at home?__

Well, on the one hand, the benefits of studying in a library are manifold. First and foremost, I can cooperate with my friends in a library. It's also worth mentioning that studying in a library makes me more focused. On the other hand, the advantages of studying at home cannot be ignored. Just to give you an idea, I can listen to my favirite music when I study. All in all, I should say, since study effectiveness is of vital importance to me, I would prefer to study in an library.

## 询问过去发生的事情

注意雅思考试会有一两道问过去情况的题来考察考生对过去时态的掌握。这时一定要使用好过去时态。

__Were your parents strict with you when you were a child?__

Despite the fact that some parents prefer a laissez-faire approach to raising their children, my parents were very strict with me. Not only did they set high standards for my coursework, but also they forced me to learn English. I have to say I didn't fully realize the importance of English at that time. I wish I could have followed their advice and put more efforts into English learning as a kid.

注意可以使用 I wish I could have 这样的虚拟语气来假设一个不同的过去。

## 询问将来的计划

Use be going to + verb to talk about plans you’ve decided on.

Use will + verb with maybe, perhaps, probably, I guess, or I think to talk about possible plans before you’ve made a decision.

两个有用的事态：将来完成时 will have + by/before. I will have probably finished my study by the end of 2025. 将来进行时 will + be doing something + time indication. 

__Will you change your job?__

Despite the fact that a lot of people are really happy with a software engineer job due to the high salary, I will probably change my job and become a software entrepreneur in the future, working in hot and existing areas like artificial intelligence or cryptocurrency. I will possibly be pursuing an MBA degree three years later to gain more knowledge in this field.

注意使用将来时。这里也可以说 I have been thinking about changing my job 但是我们可以在其他地方使用现在完成进行时，所以询问将来计划时尽量展现自己对将来时的使用。最后一句也可以换成 I will possibly have started my own business by the end on 2025. 使用将来完成时。

__Where are you going to go after the exam?__

Well, I am gonna return home. I will probably be playing a newly released game from my favorite gaming company in the afternoon. I have been looking forward to it for a long time.

__What do you want to do when you pass your IELTS exam successfully?__

Well, I am gonna submitting my results to the immigration agency of Canada since that is why I am taking this exam. I will also probably hold a party with my friends to celebrate my success.
